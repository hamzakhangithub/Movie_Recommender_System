# Movie_Recommender_System
A Movie Recommender System where the recommendations are based on a metric called cosine similarity which is to find the similarity scores between the vectors. 
But First some EDA performed on the movies dataset from kaggle to see the some info about the top movies. 
The movies in the list are converted into vectors using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
And then model built on the similarity scores.
